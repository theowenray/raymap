# RayMap

RayMap will become the successor to the earlier prototype, focusing on parcel visualization and history tracking across Shelby County, IL. This initial commit seeds the repository so hosted environments (Codespaces, cloud IDEs, etc.) can clone it while you build out the actual app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/theowenray/RayMap.git`
2. Open the project (Xcode, Swift Playgrounds, or your preferred editor).
3. Start scaffolding the SwiftUI/MapKit code or documentation you want to track in this repo.

## Roadmap Ideas

- Port the login and parcel overlay flows from the previous Raymap build.
- Integrate Shelby County GIS feeds for live parcel data.
- Track parcel history layers (sales, improvements, ownership) for analysts in the field.
